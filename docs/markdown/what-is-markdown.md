Markdown is like a way to code your text. What you're reading right now was originally written in markdown!

## What does it look like?

The text cells in a notebook use markdown. For example, I could write something like

```markdown
# Title for my notebook

This notebook has **tons** of great code examples.\
Please make changes, run them, and see what happens.

## Section 1

Here is a list of the examples we'll go over.

1. Example 1
1. Example 2
1. Example 3
```

That code will look like the following:

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD025 -->
# Title for my notebook

This notebook has **tons** of great code examples.\
Please make changes, run them, and see what happens.

## When do people use it?

### Research

Researchers sometimes use Markdown to share their research findings. R notebooks are often written in Rmd format, R Markdown. The notebooks we do on this site are ipynb format. They're Python notebooks. The text cells are Markdown, and the code cells are Python.

### Websites

Markdown is one way that people use to make websites without having to code HTML or Javascript. There are tools that take Markdown and build a website for you that can go out on the web.

### Notes

Some note-taking apps and organizational platforms let you use Markdown to jazz up plain text. I use Markdown in my notetaking apps so I can format headings, do bulleted lists (like the one in section 1 above) and other things.

### AI

Some AI chat apps provide their responses in Markdown format.

## How do I use Markdown?

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD033 -->
You can use it in <a href="/lite/lab/index.html?path=welcome.ipynb">the Lab</a>. Open a Markdown file, or a new notebook.

### Open a Markdown file from the launcher

To open a Markdown file from the launcher, you can select the blue plus button toward the upper left of the browser content window, or you can click on the launcher tab that you might typically see behind the "Welcome to the Lab" screen. It may look something like this:

![Screenshot of the Lab. A red rectangle is highlighting a blue plus button, and a red rectangle is highlighting a tab that says "Launcher"](/img/python/00-get-set-up/launcher.png)

Then you can click on Markdown.

### Open a new notebook from the launcher

Once you're at the launcher, you can also click on the "Py" button under "Notebook," which looks something like this:

![Screenshot of the Lab launcher. A red rectangle is highlighting a square that says Py toward the top of the main content frame under a section that says Notebook. There's a separate section with Py that says console.](/img/python/00-get-set-up/select-python-notebook.png)

To render/view the Markdown formatted, you can run the text cell.

### Preview Markdown

You can do Markdown in the text cells (different from code cells). For a Markdown file, you can right click and "Preview."
