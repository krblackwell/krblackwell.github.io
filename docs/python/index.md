# Getting Started in Python

Welcome to learning Python!

If you're brand new to learning how to code, remember to have fun with it. It's normal to get frustrated sometimes if something isn't working.

## FAQs on learning to code

Here are some of the questions and worries I've heard from people learning to code.

### What's the best language to learn?

It all depends on what you want to do. Python is a good language to start with because it's versatile and popular. It can help you understand important things on how to code.

### What's the best book/site/etc to learn to code?

It depends! I like books. A lot of people like videos. There are a lot of resources at your local library for free on learning to code. Some are books (but check if they're old) and some are digital courses or eBooks!

### How do you remember all this code?

It comes with practice and time.

It's ok if you understand a lesson, but have to look up the `syntax` or way to write code. I've used a number of programming languages in my career, and I don't remember every piece of syntax about all of them all the time.

### Is it worth it learning to code? AI is taking all the jobs

I think understanding coding, or at least how code shapes our lives, is valuable. You don't have to be a programmer, developer, engineer, whatever in order to use coding to make your life easier. You might want to make yourself applications or games.

Also if you just like it and find it interesting, don't let anyone stop you from learning it!

### Coding is so hard

It can be really hard! That's ok. It's normal and SO common to feel frustrated. Sometimes it takes a bit of time for things to "click." Remember to write code yourself and play around with it. Use projects and tutorials, but try to change them to make them your own. It engages your brain in a different way.

### What's your favorite language?

Java is my favorite. That's the first object-oriented language I worked with extensively.
