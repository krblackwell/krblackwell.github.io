# How to use Notebooks

- Connect the brains - kernel
- Play - run
- Fast forward - run all

## Connect the brains

A `kernel` is the brains of your notebook. It is what interprets your code and allows it to run and get output. The notebooks should default to a lightweight Python kernel for the browser called Pydiode.

See the screenshot below. For code to run, you need to see Pydiode there.

If you don't see Pydiode there, you can click on it to select a kernel.

![After clicking the 'Switch kernel' tooltip, you can select Pydiode from a drop down menu.](/img/python/00-get-set-up/kernel-select.png)
