# How to use the Lab?

- Find lessons
- Reset the Lab
- Save your notebooks
- Upload notebooks
- Launcher
- Order of tabs for a screen reader

## Find lessons

The notebook lessons are also contained in the Lab. The left side frame has a folder called "python" containing Python lessons separated into sections. Each lesson is a notebook.

You can click to expand the folders and find the notebooks.

You can make changes in the notebooks. It doesn't change anything for the website.

If you want to add a code cell to try something out, you're able to do that!

## Reset the Lab

If you need to reset the lesson, clear the browser cache. This can be done within just the Lab, or you can do it in your browser settings. It deletes all the changes you made, and any notebooks you created. If you clear cache in the browser settings, it will usually delete any history, online shopping carts, and sometimes passwords saved for other websites.

Here's how to do it in the Lab:

## Save your notebooks

If you make changes that you want to save, you can download a notebook. Right click on the file in the left frame menu and go to "Download." You can save it to your computer.

## Upload notebooks

If you want to use a notebook you saved, you can "upload" it. It's only being copied to your browser. It's not really getting uploaded anywhere.

![This is not in the right click menu. It's above the left sidebar as a small button. Tooltip says "Upload Files"](/img/python/00-get-set-up/upload-files-button.png)

## Launcher

If you want to create a blank notebook, go to the Launcher. Click the blue plus in the upper left part of the screen. Select a square that says "Py" and "Python (Pydiode)".

Notebooks are along the top row of the launcher. You'll want to click "Py" where it says "Python (Pydiode)" in small letters.
