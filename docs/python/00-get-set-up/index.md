# Get Set Up

Welcome to learning Python!

This section provides some information about how to use the site, notebooks, and the Lab.

The lessons in this site are contained in what are called notebooks. The pages in the frame to the left are just showing them to you in a different way.

The Lab is available to you so you can run the lessons in the browser as a notebook.

You can make changes in lesson notebooks or create new notebooks from scratch in the Lab. Don't worry. If you change a notebook, you can get back to the original. You have two options:

1. You can clear your entire browser cache to reset the Lab. This will delete any shopping carts, sometimes saved passwords, and other things that you might want to keep in your browser.
1. Or you can clear the cache related to the Lab by right clicking on the leftmost frame, the one that contains the folders, and selecting "Clear Browser Cache." Doing it this way has not cleared anything outside of my Jupyter Lite session within the browser that I can tell.
