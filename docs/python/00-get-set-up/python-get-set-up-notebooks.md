# What is a notebook?

The notebooks we're using to learn Python are a special kind of digital notebook where you can write notes and do computer coding in the same place.

:::tip
Scientists, mathematicians, data scientists, and computer programmers use notebooks to test out ideas, solve problems, and show their work all in one spot.
:::

These notebooks are great for researchers who want to share their research. They can present data, charts, and mix text explanations between them. The text is able to be formatted nicely for presentation and organization.

## Today's goals

- Why notebooks?
- How is this site organized? (about pages and notebooks)
- How to run them myself?

## Why notebooks? About interactive code tools

You might not be a scientist yet, so why notebooks? Notebooks are great teaching tools for a few reasons.

- You see explanation, code, and output together.
- The code here has been run and tested. You know what you're seeing will work.
- You can run code yourself!

### Explanation and code together

In a regular python program, you don't have the option to have text that's nicely formatted with headings or lists that stand out. It would look something like this:

![Screenshot of Python code with comments. It says the same thing as the print lesson. There is a header and explanatory text but they're the same size and color. Underneath that is Python code but no output.](/img/python/00-get-set-up/notebook-alternative-print.png)

The header and explanation text are the same size. This means the organization of the page isn't as clear to you. It's also not clear to a computer reading a screen for someone who doesn't see well, for example.

Below is from the Jupyter Notebook. It's a page just like this one you're looking at. On the pages, I made the output cell stand out more than it does in the notebooks by using a different color background.

That's much nicer to read than the plain code script, plus you see the output of the code directly underneath the code itself. Hopefully if anyone is using a screen reader, the output is easy to distinguish.

The pages contain the same output like this:

![Screenshot of the same lesson but in the web page](/img/python/00-get-set-up/lesson-in-page.png)

The output is formatted to stand out differently from the code and plain text.

### Code has been run and tested

As you saw, code in the notebook is already run, and output is there for you. You know what to expect if you run the code for yourself.

This site goes through a lot of automatic checks and tests (I'll explain more about that in a future lesson). These checks make sure the code is neat and follows something called `PEP8` â€” which is just a set of rules for how Python code should look.

`Code standards` like PEP8 help keep code easy to read and understand, especially when many people are working together. It's like having rules in the classroom. They help everyone know what to expect from each other. It helps everyone work together. With code, following rules makes code easier to read, understand, and fix.

Even if you're the only one working on a program, it's important. If you don't look at code for a while, you'll need a minute to look at it and remember it.

### You can run code yourself

I created the easiest way for you to get started learning. At the top of the Python lesson pages, you'll see a "badge" that can take you to the Lab.
