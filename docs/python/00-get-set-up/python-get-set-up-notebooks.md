# What is a notebook?

The notebooks we're using to learn Python are a special kind of digital notebook where you can write notes and do computer coding in the same place.

:::tip
Scientists, mathematicians, data scientists, and computer programmers use notebooks to test out ideas, solve problems, and show their work all in one spot.
:::

These notebooks are great for researchers who want to share their research. They can present data, charts, and mix text explanations between them.

## Today's goals

- Why notebooks?
- How is this site organized? (about pages and notebooks)
- How to run them myself?

## Why notebooks? About interactive code tools

You might not be a scientist yet, so why notebooks? Notebooks are great teaching tools for a few reasons.

- You see explanation, code, and output together.
- The code here has been run and tested. You know what you're seeing will work.
- You can run code yourself!

### Explanation and code together

In a regular python program, you don't have the option to have text that's nicely formatted with headings or lists that stand out. It would look something like this:

![Screenshot of Python code with comments. It says the same thing as the print lesson. There is a header and explanatory text but they're the same size and color. Underneath that is Python code but no output.](/img/python/00-get-set-up/notebook-alternative-print.png)

The header and explanation text are the same size. This means the organization of the page isn't as clear to you. It's also not clear to a computer reading a screen for someone who doesn't see well, for example.

Below is from the Jupyter Notebook. It's a page just like this one you're looking at. On the pages, I made the output cell stand out more than it does in the notebooks by using a different color background.

![Screenshot of another lesson that shows a distinct header, separate explanatory text, code and output. The code and output also are visually distinct.](/img/python/00-get-set-up/from-lesson-print.png)

That's much nicer to read than the code, plus you see the output of the code directly underneath the code itself. Hopefully if anyone is using a screen reader, the output is easy to distinguish.

### Code has been run and tested

As you saw, code in the notebook is already run, and output is available for you. You know what to expect if you run the code for yourself.

This site goes through a lot of automatic checks and tests (I'll explain more about that in a future lesson). These checks make sure the code is neat and follows something called `PEP8` — which is just a set of rules for how Python code should look.

`Code standards` like PEP8 help keep code easy to read and understand, especially when many people are working together. It's like having rules in the classroom. They help everyone know what to expect from each other. It helps everyone work together. With code, following rules makes code easier to read, understand, and fix.

Even if you're the only one working on a program, it's important. If you don't look at code for a while, you'll need a minute to look at it and remember it.

### You can run code yourself

#### Web pages can show more fun stuff

These notebooks are turned into pages so you can easily read through them and get other features that the notebooks don't do as well.

For example, there are "tips," and "warnings" that stand out, but the notebooks don't have a good way to reliably show these. One way of running notebooks might be able to show a special widget or use a code that another way can't.

#### The pages are available as notebooks

But since I start with a notebook, I save them so you can download them yourself! In addition, I add "badges" to the notebooks and pages so you can open them to run on different `platforms.`

A `platform` is a place where you can run and work with code. Some platforms run in your web browser (like Google Colab or "Try Jupyter") and others are apps you install on your computer (like Jupyter Notebook). Think of a platform like the “desk” where you do your coding—it’s where everything happens!

If you've ever been on Roblox, you know you can play games on there. Roblox is a platform that allows you to create and play games.

## Use the notebook to run code yourself

If you download the notebooks, you can run the code on your computer. I'll include lessons on how to install Python and Jupyter Notebooks, and how to use them. However, that can be a pain! You want to get started learning now, right?

### Easiest way to get started

#### Google Colab

The pages include a "badge" for Google Colab, which requires a Google account to run notebooks. That means you need to ask your parent or guardian if you can have an account. It's free, and it would allow you to play around with the lessons as you read them.

#### "Try Jupyter"

[Try JupyterLite](https://jupyter.org/try)

Jupyter Notebooks has a browser version that you can click on to use a notebook for free.

You can upload notebooks to use in the browser, too.
