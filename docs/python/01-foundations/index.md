# Foundations

This section goes over basic things you need to know to understand how to code.

- prints
- variables
- f-strings
- naming conventions
- string methods
- documentation
- lists and strings
- lists
- dictionaries
- comparisons

## Do projects

And I provide a number of projects. They are tagged as "project" and include other tags for the things you need to understand to do them. The projects folders are under each section.

## **`slice`**

The alien translator v1 introduces the concept of `slice`. You can slice lists and strings to access parts of them.

## **`random`**

The projects [Compliment Generator v1](/docs/python/foundations/projects/compliment-generator-v1), [Silly Story v2](/docs/python/foundations/projects/story-project-v2), and [Silly Story v3](/docs/python/foundations/projects/story-project-v3) use and teach the `random` library.

## Keep going

Don't be shy if you don't remember 100% of a lesson. Following along with a project or game can help you remember and understand! The best way to learn is to make things from a blank page, even if you have to look up how to code something. Switch between the lessons and projects if you need to.

And remember to make it your own by trying to change things, add things, `print()` to see what something looks like.\
