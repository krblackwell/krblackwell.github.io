You can use it to make games, process documents, automate tasks, or just understand technology better. It\'s a great skill for everyone.\\n\\nThis site is built with kids in mind, but it\'s designed so adults won\'t find it annoying.\\n\\n## What You\'ll Find Here\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc0d Interactive Python Lessons\\n\\nStart with beginner and kid-friendly lessons. All example code is tested so everything runs smoothly.\\n\\nCoding helps you think differently. As a coder myself, I\u2019ll share my knowledge about:\\n\\n- Coding\\n- Systems\\n- Program design\\n- Problem-solving approaches\\n\\nI don\u2019t want you to just **learn code**. I want you to learn to **build good programs**.\\n\\n\x3c!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD033 --\x3e\\n### \ud83e\uddea Live Coding Notebooks in <a href=\\"/lite/lab/index.html?path=welcome.ipynb\\">The Lab</a>\\n\\nLessons are created as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) \u2014 interactive coding documents.\\n\\nThanks to [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), you can run code **right in your browser** \u2014 no setup, no login, just start coding.\\n\\n### Tags\\n\\nThere\'s no site-wide search (yet), but you can browse by **tags** at the bottom of blogs and lessons.\\n\\n### Blog for Parents & Teachers\\n\\nCheck out the blog for **tips, ideas**, and **inspiration** to support young coders (and maybe learn something new yourself!)\\n\\n## How to Get Started\\n\\n### Browse Lessons\\n\\nClick the Python link in the menu up top to jump into your first lesson. If you don\'t see anything, you\'ll need to click the hamburger menu, which looks like 3 lines: \u2630\\n\\n[Or just click here to go to the first lesson on `print()`](/docs/python/foundations/python-foundations-print)\\n\\nEach lesson includes a link to an **interactive notebook** at the top. It is currently a yellow button that says \\"Try Lite Now.\\" Run code directly and test your understanding by writing some yourself.\\n\\nThere are navigation links at the top of the notebooks to return to the lesson page.\\n\\n### Explore the Glossary\\n\\nWe\u2019ve got a built-in **dictionary** for coding terms. Refer to it anytime you\'re unsure about a word or concept."}]}}')}}]);
