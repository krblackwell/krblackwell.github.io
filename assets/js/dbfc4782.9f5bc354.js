I think it\'s ok to skip around and learn things here and there. Some people learn better by diving in to a hands-on example. This is partly why I don\'t label anything \\"beginner,\\" \\"intermediate,\\" etc. Some people learn by skipping around and following interesting breadcrumbs.\\n\\nEspecially for kids who are learning. If you\'re not learning because you need to for work, then you can skip around and build momentum.\\n\\nHowever, I created the lessons and projects so that they build off one another a little at a time. A few projects contain information that isn\'t in its own lesson. Those are mentioned on the page for that section.\\n\\n[Foundation section mentions one project that teaches slicing strings and lists](/docs/python/foundations)\\n\\n[An absolute beginner\'s project](/docs/python/foundations/projects/story-project-v1)\\n\\nI label the projects with tags based on what you need to know, like \\"strings\\" for the string library, \\"f-string\\" if I\'m using f-strings specifically. A few have the label \\"print\\" because they are the first projects or games you can do as an absolute beginner. I don\'t continue using \\"print\\" for a tag on every project, because we\'re using print almost everywhere.\\n\\n## Example Project\\n\\nThe below gives you an idea of what the Silly Story project is. It uses concepts learned in the lessons like f-strings, lists, and dictionaries.

The lab runs entirely in your browser and is powered by JupyterLite, a lightweight version of the Jupyter Notebook platform.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## How Does the Lab Work\\n\\nYou might be wondering whether the lab environment is safe. It is, and I\u2019m 100% comfortable letting my kids use it.\\n\\nThe lab runs entirely in your browser and is powered by JupyterLite, a lightweight version of the Jupyter Notebook platform. According to the JupyterLite team:\\n\\n>\u201cThe goal is to provide a lightweight computing environment accessible in a matter of\\n>seconds with a single click, in a web browser and without having to install anything.\u201d\\n\\nThat means:\\n\\n- No installation required\\n\\n- Fast and lightweight\\n\\n- Runs in your browser (even on your phone)\\n\\n- Use it on a tablet, laptop, or desktop computer for the best experience, but it will work on mobile. The web pages look better on a small screen than the notebooks.\\n\\nSo if you\'re limited to a small tiny screen, focus on the lesson pages. You can open them in the Lab when you\'re ready to do some code.\\n\\nJupyterLite is affiliated with Jupyter.org, a well-known and trusted organization in the scientific computing community. I didn\u2019t build the lab myself, but I\u2019ve tested it, and feel confident recommending it.\\n\\n## What Happens If Something Goes Wrong\\n\\nSince this runs in your browser, it\u2019s relatively safe and isolated. I\u2019ve stress-tested it with infinite loops \u2014 and while you can\'t always stop runaway code directly in the notebook, you can simply close the browser tab to shut it down.\\n\\nWorst case scenario you can delete browser cache from the last hour or whenever you were using it. Just remember that deleting browser cache will delete other things your browser might be saving for you like shopping carts that aren\'t saved in an account or passwords or credit card info, depending on your settings and browser.\\n\\n## A few safety notes\\n\\nDon\u2019t download or run notebooks from sources you don\u2019t trust. Even though the environment is limited, a malicious notebook from outside my website could trick you into clicking a bad link or crash your browser.\\n\\nFiles you upload are only stored in your browser\'s memory (local storage). I won\u2019t see them, and they\u2019ll disappear if you clear your browser cache.\\n\\nDon\'t put anything in there that you want to keep. It\'s a temporary space, not permanent storage.\\n\\nThe lab doesn\u2019t connect to an external server. It\u2019s self-contained. This is perfect for our purposes, but it is a limited environment.\\n\\nSo enjoy learning coding without the set up! I think if someone wants to code and get really into it, they can learn to set up stuff later."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-06-welcome/index.md","title":"Learn to Code for Free","description":"This blog is here for teachers, parents, and guardians who want to support their learners.

You can use it to make games, process documents, automate tasks, or just understand technology better. It\'s a great skill for everyone.\\n\\nThis site is built with kids in mind, but it\'s designed so adults won\'t find it annoying.\\n\\n## What You\'ll Find Here\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc0d Interactive Python Lessons\\n\\nStart with beginner and kid-friendly lessons. All example code is tested so everything runs smoothly.\\n\\nCoding helps you think differently. As a coder myself, I\u2019ll share my knowledge about:\\n\\n- Coding\\n- Systems\\n- Program design\\n- Problem-solving approaches\\n\\nI don\u2019t want you to just **learn code**. I want you to learn to **build good programs**.\\n\\n\x3c!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD033 --\x3e\\n### \ud83e\uddea Live Coding Notebooks in <a href=\\"/lite/lab/index.html?path=welcome.ipynb\\">The Lab</a>\\n\\nLessons are created as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) \u2014 interactive coding documents.\\n\\nThanks to [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), you can run code **right in your browser** \u2014 no setup, no login, just start coding.\\n\\n### Tags\\n\\nThere\'s no site-wide search (yet), but you can browse by **tags** at the bottom of blogs and lessons.\\n\\n### Blog for Parents & Teachers\\n\\nCheck out the blog for **tips, ideas**, and **inspiration** to support young coders (and maybe learn something new yourself!)\\n\\n## How to Get Started\\n\\n### Browse Lessons\\n\\nClick the Python link in the menu up top to jump into your first lesson. If you don\'t see anything, you\'ll need to click the hamburger menu, which looks like 3 lines: \u2630\\n\\n[Or just click here to go to the first lesson on `print()`](/docs/python/foundations/print)\\n\\nEach lesson includes a link to an **interactive notebook** at the top. It is currently a yellow button that says \\"Try Lite Now.\\" Run code directly and test your understanding by writing some yourself.\\n\\nThere are navigation links at the top of the notebooks to return to the lesson page.\\n\\n### Explore the Glossary\\n\\nWe\u2019ve got a built-in **dictionary** for coding terms. Refer to it anytime you\'re unsure about a word or concept."}]}}')}}]);
