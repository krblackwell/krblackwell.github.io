    "When working with data on people, you usually have age, and often you `recode` age into categories. You take age 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc, and group them together. A variable like age being in some number of years (20, 21, 22, 23, etc) is called a `continuous` variable. We'll recode it to a `categorical` where it will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and each of those numbers means a bunch of ages grouped together.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I print \"1: 0-3 years\" this is because often you `recode` variables/columns when you work with data. The recode will create number or string categories. In our example below, let's imagine we create categories like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| recode | age in years |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| 1 | 0-3 |\n",
    "| 2 | 4-13 |\n",
    "| 3 | 14-20 |\n",
    "| 4 | 21-64 |\n",
    "| 5 | 65+ |\n",
    "\n",
    "We cover every age category because we end with \"65+\" meaning 65 and older.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age can be grouped in different ways depending on what you're studying and what type of things you're interested in knowing about. For example, if you want to know about driving, age 16 is significant because in the USA that's when you can get a license. But if you have to work, you can get it earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a lot of frameworks/packages that help you work with data, you can make labels for your columns and variables. So our print below is going to be like the label. When I'm working with a variable, I make sure to include the value in the label, and the description. In our case, \"1: 0-3 years\" lets us know that recode=1 means 0 - 3 years of age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables/columns can have descriptions added to them too, so the label for the recode (which here is just a print statement and not actually something being output) would be \"recode: age in years category.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If you sort of followed that, that's fine. We'll cover working with data in a different lesson section."
