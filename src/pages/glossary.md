# ðŸ“˜ Glossary for words and definitions used on this website

- **best practice** \
  A recommended way of doing something thatâ€™s widely accepted as clear, effective, and efficient. It helps you avoid problems later on.
  
  ```python
  # for example, using descriptive variable names is a best practice
  user_age = 12
  ```
- **cast**\
  Changing a value from one data type to another (e.g. from a string to an integer).

  ```python
  age = "12" # age as a string
  age = int("12")  # casts a string to an integer
  ```

- **code standards**\
  Rules or guidelines for writing clean, consistent code (often project- or language-specific).

  ```python
  # Following code standards like consistent indentation and proper naming
  def greet_user(name):
      return f"Hello, {name}"
  ```

- **concatenate**\
  To link things together, like combining two strings into one.

  ```python
  full_name = "Ada" + " " + "Lovelace"
  ```

- **convert**\
  To change a value from one form to another, such as a number to text (similar to "cast").

  ```python
  num_as_str = str(42)  # Converts integer to string
  ```

- **f-string**\
  A way to format strings in Python using curly braces to insert variables.

  ```python
  name = "Toby"
  greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"
  ```

- **integer**\
  A whole number, positive or negative, without decimals (e.g. 5, -3, 42).

  ```python
  score = 100  # This is an integer
  ```

- **kernel**\
  The core part of a computer program or environment that runs and manages code, especially in tools like Jupyter Notebooks.

  ```python
  # In Jupyter, the kernel runs this code cell
  print("The kernel executed this cell")
  ```

- **markdown**\
  A lightweight text formatting language used to style text (like **bold** or `code`) in files.

  ```markdown
  **This is bold text in markdown**
  ```

- **nested**\
  When one structure is placed inside another, like a list within a list or an `if` statement inside a loop.

  ```python
  for i in range(3):
      if i % 2 == 0:
          print(f"{i} is even")
  ```

- **pep8**\
  Pythonâ€™s official style guide that outlines how to write readable and consistent Python code.

  ```python
  # PEP8 suggests using lowercase with underscores for variable names
  # user_name is a variable, and is in what's called "snake case"
  user_name = "Seth"
  ```

- **print**\
  A function that shows output in the console or terminal.

  ```python
  print("Hello, world!")
  ```

- **string**\
  A sequence of characters, usually text (e.g. `"hello"` or `'123'`).

  ```python
  message = "This is a string"
  ```

- **user**\
  A person interacting with the software or code.

  ```python
  user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
  ```

- **variable**\
  A named container in code used to store data values.

  ```python
  x = 10  # x is a variable holding the value 10
  ```
