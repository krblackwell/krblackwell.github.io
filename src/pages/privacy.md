# Privacy Policy

Last Updated 6/26/25

This website is created by a regular mom in the United States. I have two kids, a spouse, and some pets. I have no interest in collecting and selling your behavior or cookies as you interact with this site.

## COPPA

This site is intended to be accessible for kids, and I'm building this website assuming that children under 13 will use it.

I'm not knowingly or purposely collecting any information on users, grown ups or children. However, this website uses Github Pages, and here is more information on the types of information they may collect: 

- [What is Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages)
- [GitHub General Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)

>[From GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages), last accessed 6/26/2025:
>"When a GitHub Pages site is visited, the visitor's IP address is logged and stored for security purposes, regardless of whether the visitor has signed into GitHub or not.\
>For more information about GitHub's security practices, [see GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)."

## Cookies

I don't add any additional cookies, and I'm not collecting cookies, but GitHub might. This site uses cookies provided by GitHub Pages for functionality and analytics. Learn more at [What is Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages).

## The Lab - Jupyter Lite

Jupyter Lite is running in your browser and is not sending data to a server. Any files or changes to files saved are local to you and sandboxed. 

This means that third parties should not be able to access those notebooks or files, and you're only able to access them when you visit this site's Jupyter Lite page, that I call "the Lab." The files you create in there, you can click to download to your device also.

You can clear your entire browser cache to reset the Lab, or you can clear the cache related to the Lab by right clicking on the leftmost frame, the one that contains the folders, and selecting "Clear Browser Cache."
