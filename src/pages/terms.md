# Terms of Use

This site is available to help you learn how to code for free. I want to make learning to code painless and easy. No logins for lessons, no subscription, no "enter your credit card info."

The site is intentionally simple to make it easier for you to use and for me to maintain. The simpler it is, the less complicated the terms and privacy policy can be.

By using this website, you agree to the following terms:

## No Tampering

Please don't try to mess up the site for everyone.

You may not interfere with, alter, or disrupt the website or its functionality in any way. This includes attempting to reverse-engineer, hack, or gain unauthorized access to any part of the site or its content.

You might wonder how this applies to the Lab, because you can easily mess up the Lab, but only for yourself. The way to fix it is to clear browser cache. Please read on and please understand what happens when you clear browser cache.

## Free Content Usage

All content provided on this site is offered for free and for non-commercial use only.

## No Liability

Any code, tools, or guidance provided on this site are offered as-is, without warranties of any kind. If you use any code or content from this site, you do so at your own risk. This is more important for when you play around with coding yourself.

The code is running within your browser if you use the Lab, so one risk includes having to close your browser if you can't stop an infinite loop. If you have to clear your browser cache to reset the Lab, you might lose data in your browser. Depending on the browser or your settings, you could lose shopping cart data, data saved in forms, credit cards saved in your browser, whatever things that you can save in the browser.

The site owner is not responsible for any damage, loss, or issues that arise from your use of the content, including but not limited to technical problems, data loss, or financial losses.

## Third Party Links

This website has some links to third-party websites. I do my best to make sure links go somewhere safe-ish, but big tech algorithms can start showing you some bad stuff real quick. I'm looking at you Instagram and Youtube. It can be like the wild west out there, so be careful where you go!
