    <p>üöß This site is still under construction ‚Äî but stay tuned!</p>
    <p>
      We're building a learning space for <strong>kids</strong>, <strong>parents</strong>, and <strong>teachers</strong> who want to explore coding together.

    <h2>The Mission</h2>
    <p>
      I want learning to code to be easy and available for free. Learning to code is about problem-solving, creativity, and learning how to figure things out. <strong>AI can't always give you an answer that works!</strong> My goal is to make coding meaningful to learners of all ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is created with kids in mind, but I know how helpful it is to have free interactive lessons without a login!
    </p>

    <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

    <h3>Interactive Python Lessons</h3>
    <p>
      Start with beginner-friendly lessons written in clear language. Lesson code is all tested so it works seamlessly for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of coding is learning to think in a different way. I'm a data engineer so I can share my knowledge of coding, systems, program design and approaches. I don't want you to just learn code. I want you to learn how to code good programs!
    </p>

    <h3>Live Coding Notebooks</h3>
    <p>
      The lessons are created first as <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupyter notebooks</a>. They are interactive ways of coding. And thanks to a package called <a href="https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JupyterLite</a>, you can run and experiment with code right in your browser ‚Äî no setup, no login, just coding.
    </p>

    <h3>Glossary & Tags</h3>
    <p>
      Not sure what a word means? The glossary and descriptive tags help you find topics and projects that interest you.
    </p>

    <h3>Blog for Parents & Teachers</h3>
    <p>
      Tips, ideas, and inspiration for supporting young coders (and maybe learning something new yourself!).
    </p>

    <h2>How to Get Started</h2>

    <h3>Browse Lessons</h3>
    <p>
