import SillyStoryJS from '@site/src/components/SillyStoryJS'

One of the hurdles to coding is fear of the blank page. Sometimes, people can get stuck doing many tutorials and lessons without coding a line themselves. I picture learners following the notebook for a project to see how to do it. Then, they can add on to it <a href="/lite/lab/index.html?path=welcome.ipynb">in the Lab</a>, or they can <a href="/lite/lab/index.html">start a fresh notebook</a> and see if they remember how to do it themselves.

## Learning Python With Projects

The projects available on this site are meant to be fun. I think it's ok to skip around and learn things here and there. Some people learn better by diving in to a hands-on example. This is partly why I don't label anything "beginner," "intermediate," etc. Some people learn by skipping around and following interesting breadcrumbs.

Especially for kids who are learning. If you're not learning because you need to for work, then you can skip around and build momentum.

However, I created the lessons and projects so that they build off one another a little at a time. A few projects contain information that isn't in its own lesson. Those are mentioned on the page for that section.

[Foundation section mentions one project that teaches slicing strings and lists](/docs/python/foundations)

[An absolute beginner's project](/docs/python/foundations/projects/story-project-v1)

I label the projects with tags based on what you need to know, like "strings" for the string library, "f-string" if I'm using f-strings specifically. A few have the label "print" because they are the first projects or games you can do as an absolute beginner. I don't continue using "print" for a tag on every project, because we're using print almost everywhere.

## Example Project

The below gives you an idea of what the Silly Story project is. It uses concepts learned in the lessons like f-strings, lists, and dictionaries. [We have several versions in the projects for the foundations section](/docs/python/foundations/projects)

You can change the words however many times you want and click on "Create Story."
