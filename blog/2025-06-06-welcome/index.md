## The Mission

I want learning to code to be **easy** and **free**.

Coding is about **problem-solving**, **creativity**, and **figuring things out**. You can use it to make games, process documents, automate tasks, or just understand technology better. It's a great skill for everyone.

This site is built with kids in mind, but it's designed so adults won't find it annoying.

## What You'll Find Here

### üêç Interactive Python Lessons

Start with beginner and kid-friendly lessons. All example code is tested so everything runs smoothly.

Coding helps you think differently. As a coder myself, I‚Äôll share my knowledge about:

- Coding
- Systems
- Program design
- Problem-solving approaches

I don‚Äôt want you to just **learn code**. I want you to learn to **build good programs**.

### üß™ Live Coding Notebooks in [The Lab](/lite/lab/index.html?path=welcome.md)

Lessons are created as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) ‚Äî interactive coding documents.

Thanks to [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), you can run code **right in your browser** ‚Äî no setup, no login, just start coding.

### Tags

There's no site-wide search (yet), but you can browse by **tags** at the bottom of blogs and lessons.

### Blog for Parents & Teachers

Check out the blog for **tips, ideas**, and **inspiration** to support young coders (and maybe learn something new yourself!)

## How to Get Started

### Browse Lessons

Click the Python link in the menu up top to jump into your first lesson. If you don't see anything, you'll need to click the hamburger menu, which looks like 3 lines: ‚ò∞

[Or just click here to go to the first lesson on `print()`](/docs/python/foundations/python-foundations-print)

Each lesson includes a link to an **interactive notebook** at the top. It is currently a yellow button that says "Try Lite Now." Run code directly and test your understanding by writing some yourself.

There are navigation links at the top of the notebooks to return to the lesson page.

### Explore the Glossary

We‚Äôve got a built-in **dictionary** for coding terms. Refer to it anytime you're unsure about a word or concept.
